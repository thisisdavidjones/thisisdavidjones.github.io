Ancient Rome used sacred chickens and the innards of slaughtered animals. Other historical methods of divination include:</p><ul><li>pyromancy <em>(by fire)</em></li><li>ophiomancy <em>(by snakes)</em></li><li>pegomancy <em>(by spring water)</em></li><li>anemoscopy <em>(by wind)</em></li><li>daphnomancy <em>(by burning laurel wreaths)</em></li><li>hippomancy <em>(by horses)</em></li><li>tiromancy <em>(by cheese)</em></li></ul><p>Way out East, Ancient China used the patterns made by throwing yarrow stalks to the ground as a starting point for <em>cleromancy</em> using the <em><strong>I Ching</strong></em>.</p><p>On the reasonable assumption none of these <em>work</em> in the sense of actually predicting the future, why did people use them, in some cases for many centuries? I think it&rsquo;s because all these practices rely on seeding thought processes with some random element &ndash; and that inclusion of randomness can be beneficial.</p><p>More recently, Brian Eno and Peter Schmidt have created decks of cards printed with gnomic advice as a means of overcoming creative blocks. Their <em>Oblique Strategies</em> include suggestions such as:</p><ul><li>Use an old idea</li><li>State the problem in words as clearly as possible</li><li>Only one element of each kind</li><li>What would your closest friend do?</li><li>What to increase? What to reduce?</li><li>Are there sections? Consider transitions</li><li>Try faking it!</li><li>Honour thy error as a hidden intention</li><li>Ask your body</li><li>Work at a different speed</li></ul><figure><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/Brian_Eno_-_TopPop_1974_12.png alt="Brian Eno, inventor of Oblique Strategies, before he adopted the black turtleneck"><span class=marginnote><p>Brian Eno, inventor of Oblique Strategies, before he adopted the black turtleneck</p></span></figure><p>Eno and Schmidt are clear that their cards are intended to jerk people out of thought tramlines. And that&rsquo;s what ancient divination methods probably did too: they gave licence to express thoughts, and they prompted thinking and action in new and unexepected directions.</p><h2 id=the-usefulness--of-random-pertubations>The usefulness of random pertubations</h2><p>Evolutionary biology makes use of the notion of an <em>Evolutionary Stable Strategy</em>, borrowing from economics and the Nash Equilibrium (that&rsquo;s John Nash of <em>&lsquo;Beautiful Mind&rsquo;</em> fame).</p><p>An ESS is a fitness solution that has arrived at a (local) fitness maximum. It may be useful to imagine a landscape of hills dotted about a plain, where any ESS would be represented by the summit of one of those hilla. A relatively small departure from the ESS would be the equivalent of heading <em>downhill</em>; that is, the solution will result in decreased fitness &ndash; ie, decreased reproductive success &ndash; and so won&rsquo;t spread through the population.</p><p>But in the whole landscape of solutions there may be higher summits - more effective fitness solutions. It&rsquo;s just that any mutation pushing an organism in the direction of a higher hilltop will be instantly penalised by first having to head downwards.</p><p>Now if the organism were <em>forced</em> downhill by something it would have to start again, in a random direction, trying to find higher ground (it&rsquo;s very difficult to escape teleological language but it could be done). In doing that, it might head off in a direction that took it towards a better solution.</p><p>In fact, some neural networks have a little randomness thrown in exactly to get round this problem of settling on a local but non-optimal solution. And that&rsquo;s what Eno was doing in his Oblique Strategies.</p><h3 id=the-i-ching-again>The I Ching, Again</h3><p>I first came across the <em>I Ching</em> when I was at school and read in <em>The Glass Bead Game</em> about Joseph Knecht, <em>Magister Ludi</em>, casting yarrow stalks . The text of the <em>I Ching</em> is of an age with Homer, probably older. The part used for divination lists 64 patterns and adds commetary for each. The commentary has been expanded by scholars and Jung said of it: <em>&lsquo;Even to the most biased eye, it is obvious that this book represents one long admonition to careful scrutiny of one&rsquo;s own character, attitude, and motive&rsquo;.</em></p><p>Jung was a bit of a mystic himself but I&rsquo;m appealing for the use of constructive randomness in problem-solving and I&rsquo;m quite intrigued by the use of a handy divination tradition, with supporting mobile phone apps and a long history of commentary to help tease out thoughts and directions you were half-suspecting might work but weren&rsquo;t quite brave enough to implement.</p><figure><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/35/I_Ching_Song_Dynasty_print.jpg/1024px-I_Ching_Song_Dynasty_print.jpg alt="A page from a Song Dynasty edition of the I Ching"><span class=marginnote><p>A page from a Song Dynasty edition of the I Ching</p></span></figure><p>So I think I&rsquo;m going to incorporate the I Ching into my decision-making, to throw in that little bit of left field thinking that might make all the difference.</p></section></article></body></html>
