I tried to mimic it again and again, with scratchy-nibbed dip-pens, different weights and finishes of paper; and I never got there. I have never been able to reproduce the line.</p><p>Why didn&rsquo;t I do more research? I&rsquo;ve just discovered what his process was for these sorts of drawings.</p><p>He would cover one side of a linen cloth with black oil paint; leave it a day to mostly dry; turn it paint-side down on card; place his preparatory drawing over the clean side of the linen; and, using a stylus, trace over his drawing. The black oil would push through onto the card, with some of the texture of the linen and a fair amount of smudginess from his hands as he bore down on the paper. He&rsquo;d then apply watercolour washes or maybe ink washes. The card would take the colour and the oiled line would resist it.</p><p>Guess what I&rsquo;m trying at the weekend.</p></section></article></body></html>
