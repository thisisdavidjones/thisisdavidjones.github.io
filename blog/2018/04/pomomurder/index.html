And then postmodernism. I quite liked some Roland Barthes. I read Jonathan Culler on deconstruction &ndash; <em>&ldquo;On Deconstruction&rdquo;</em> &ndash; and I read Derrida, and Baudrillard, and de Man, and Foucault, and Lacan, and more. I went back to Saussure and the Russian Formalists. I read LÃ©vi-Strauss (the anthropologist, not the maker of jeans).</p><figure class=figimg><a href=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Derrida_main.jpg><img src=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/44/Derrida_main.jpg alt="Jacques Derrida.

How could anyone take this poseur seriously?</p></span></figure><p>So believe me, I know what I&rsquo;m talking about when I say the vast majority of it is utter nonsense. Guff. Verbiage. Deliberately obscure. I put a fair amount of time and mental effort into trying to wring some meaning from <em>On Grammatology</em> and concluded, with others, that <em>&lsquo;He&rsquo;s difficult to summarise because it&rsquo;s nonsense&rsquo;</em>, and with Chomsky when he wrote:</p><blockquote>'I found the scholarship appalling, based on pathetic misreading; and the argument, such as it was, failed to come close to the kinds of standards I've been familiar with since virtually childhood'.</blockquote><p>Postmodernism did considerable damage to the reputation of the Humanities and to the enthusiasm of individuals who&rsquo;d innocently signed-up for an Eng Lit degree because they <em>liked reading novels</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t just a bit of a laugh &ndash; Alan Sokal <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair>hoaxed the respected</a> journal <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair><em>Social Text</em></a> because, as committed activist, he was concerned that the postmodernist gang were playing games and that the intellectual Left was getting lazy.</p><p>Imagine my delight, then, when I came across the novel, <strong>The 7th Function of Language</strong>, which suggests that the death in 1980 of Roland Barthes was no accident but that he&rsquo;d been murdered because he was in posession of some powerful information about language itself. It calls Foucault a &lsquo;slaphead&rsquo;. It also has Derrida himself torn apart by dogs belonging to the American philosopher, John Searle.</p><p>Great fun. Though as one of the luminaries of the PoMo world, Julia Kristeva, has just been revealed to have been a communist spy for - among all possible choices - <em>Bulgaria</em>, there might just be more to the novel than an an overdue satire.</p></section></article></body></html>
