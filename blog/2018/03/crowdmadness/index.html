Then there are the psychoses shared on a smaller scale - the <em>folie à deux</em>, a syndrome where delusional beliefs may be shared with another person – or, more generally, the <em>folie à plusieurs</em>,
known to <abbr title="The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders">DSM</abbr> as the <strong>Shared Psychotic Disorder</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>A startling example of the folie à deux is that of the twins <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_and_Sabina_Eriksson>Ursula and Sabina Eriksson</a> who, among other things, deliberately and repeatedly hurled themselves in front of motorway traffic</p></blockquote><p>Architecturally, a <strong>spandrel</strong> is the roughly triangular space between two arches and the ceiling. They&rsquo;re by-products of having arches and ceilings - nobody <em>planned</em> a spandrel. Pretty soon, though, artists realised they could decorate these incidental surfaces and they became features of interest.</p><figure class=figimg><a href=https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7486/27239975281_bf59c7832e_z.jpg><img src=https://c2.staticflickr.com/8/7486/27239975281_bf59c7832e_z.jpg alt="Spandrels in the Dom at Aachen"></a><span class=marginnote><p>Spandrels in the Dom at Aachen</p></span></figure><p>By extension, Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin called the accidental by-products of evolution, &lsquo;spandrels&rsquo;. They were critiquing an adaptationist point of view that saw every phenotypic feature as a fitness solution. Not everything, they argued, can be understood as an adaptation to evolutionary pressure. Sometimes stuff just happened.</p><p>But it seems unlikely that humans have <em>accidentally</em> acquired our great capacity for delusion, not least because of its potential to be counterproductive <em>unless</em> it conferred a benefit. Indeed, it doesn&rsquo;t take too much imagination to see how a tendency to share and promulgate convictions could be advantageous among relatively small groups of evolving humans who were likely to be related to some close degree.</p><p>Given we have this inclination, perhaps folies à plusieurs are the stuff of our everyday lives. Perhaps we ought to expect to find our families and our workplaces <em>relying</em> upon a penchant for shared delusions and our willingness to maintain implausible fictions.</p><p>Soon after you&rsquo;ve left a long-held job, say, the daily urgencies seem very like a strange psychotic episode; and the hierarchies, demands and necessities of what was just a short time ago so terribly important suddenly vanish – not <em>only</em> because you’re no longer working at that particular job but because the delusion that that job and that company were so very vital and important is no longer being shared.</p></section></article></body></html>
