Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi
Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi
The willows at the inn are fresh and green
The dust is dampened by the morning dew
I buy my friend another cup of wine
Beyond Yang Pass, good wine and friends are few â€” Wang Wei, 8th C</description></item><item><title>Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2022/08/seeingoffyuan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2022/08/seeingoffyuan/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying my hand at translating Tang-era poems again.

So for Pi Day I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at Monte Carlo simulations in R. Here&amp;rsquo;s the result of a simple simulation of pi.
Four simulation runs to estimate pi with an increasing number of iterations
Four runs, the first with 1,000 iterations; the second with 10,000; the third with 100,000, the fourth with 1,000,000.</description></item></channel></rss>
