The version of the novel I had, the translation by John Rutherford (winner of the 2002 Primo Valle Inclàn Prize) definitely plumps for <em>Kwiksot</em> in its rhymes. For example, on page 222 (Chapter XXVI) of the paperback, he translates a poem to read:</p><blockquote><p>Enough to fill the biggest pot<br>Are tears of doleful Don Quixote<br>…<br>And when it touched his tender spot<br>Tears flowed from doleful Don Quixote<br></p></blockquote><p>So no confusion there. My previous assumption of <em>Key-ho-tay</em> was an affectation I adopted because I thought it sounded more foreign.</p><p>But hang on a moment. Checking the Spanish equivalent I find it reads:</p><blockquote><p>‘Y en tocándole el cogote,<br>Aquí lloró Don Quijote’<br>— El Ingenioso Hidalgo de Don Quijote de la Mancha. Capítulo XXVI</p></blockquote><p><em>Quijote</em>, it turns out, is the modern Spanish rendition, after spelling reforms — <em>Quixote</em>K is the spelling in medieval Castilian — and according to <em>Yahoo’s Spanish Dictionary: translation of cogote</em>, ‘cogote’ is pronounced <em>Koggo-tay</em>, which would mean that Quixote is said <em>Key-Ho-Tay</em> after all.</p><p>Obviously, Rutherford’s translation is cleverly making allowance for a traditional English mispronunciation. On another page his translation reads,</p><blockquote><p>‘…Don Biscuit, or Don Fixit, or Don Riskit’.
‘Don Quixote he must have said, Lady,’ Sancho interrupted</p></blockquote><p>Which carries through the Kwiksot pronunciation. And as Wikipedia points out, traditional English rendering is also preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival form <em>quixotic</em>.</p></section></article></body></html>
