&lt;p>I recently saw a video circulating on X of a white French man walking through a town in Algeria. The camera followed him along backstreets as several women passed by wearing robes that covered them head to toe with a single hole for one eye to peer through. It was &amp;rsquo;tradition&amp;rsquo;, he was told by a smiling (male) local. But the video seemed not to generate outraged threads or articles. No public figures commented on it, nobody satirised it, or critiqued it. No editorials were written in response. It passed cleanly through digital space with a collective shrug.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
