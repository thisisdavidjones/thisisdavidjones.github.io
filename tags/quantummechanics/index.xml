This interpretation suggests that quantum events spawn multiple branches of reality, with each possible outcome manifesting in its own universe. The implications of this become extraordinary when we consider the nature of probability across an infinite number of universe branches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a simple quantum event: a particle that could decay or not decay in a given moment. In the Many Worlds interpretation, both outcomes occur, creating two branches of reality. Now extend this to the countless quantum events occurring in every atom of your body, every second of every day. The number of branches multiplies exponentially, creating an unfathomable number of parallel realities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
