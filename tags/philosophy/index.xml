Bayes Theorem - the basics Stephen Hawking said he was once told that the inclusion of each equation in his book would cut the number of interested readers by 50%. Nevertheless, this one isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to grasp though it might appear to be using slightly odd syntax if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen how conditional probabilities are expressed.</description></item><item><title>The noble lie of Ada Lovelace</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/adalovelace/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2023 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/adalovelace/</guid><description>Despite Ada Lovelace Day, the Ada Lovelace Institute, the Ada Lovelace Award and Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s confirmation that Ada Lovelace is &amp;lsquo;often regarded as the first computer programmer&amp;rsquo;, Lovelace was not the first programmer and she had no hand in the creation of the Babbage Difference Engine and Analytic Engine. Does the exaggeration of her contribution matter? Is it a noble lie? Not only is there no evidence that Lovelace ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.</description></item></channel></rss>
