Its apparent contradictions — ancient yet modern, polytheistic yet philosophically abstract, deeply ritualistic yet fluid — have long resisted Western attempts at categorisation. Traditional religious frameworks, with their emphasis on fixed doctrines and clear taxonomies, seem to slip through our fingers when trying to grasp Shinto&amp;rsquo;s essential nature. Yet rather than viewing this resistance as a barrier to understanding, we might see it as a window into Shinto&amp;rsquo;s unique character.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The Quantum Path to Improbability</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/quantumimmortality/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2024 08:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/quantumimmortality/</guid><description>&lt;p>In the vast landscape of quantum mechanics, few interpretations have captured the imagination quite like Hugh Everett III&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em>Many Worlds&lt;/em> approach. This interpretation suggests that quantum events spawn multiple branches of reality, with each possible outcome manifesting in its own universe. The implications of this become extraordinary when we consider the nature of probability across an infinite number of universe branches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consider a simple quantum event: a particle that could decay or not decay in a given moment. In the Many Worlds interpretation, both outcomes occur, creating two branches of reality. Now extend this to the countless quantum events occurring in every atom of your body, every second of every day. The number of branches multiplies exponentially, creating an unfathomable number of parallel realities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Bayesian Thinking</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/bayesianepistemology/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/bayesianepistemology/</guid><description>&lt;div class="pagedescription">The death of Mike Lynch and others on board his yacht &amp;lsquo;Bayesian&amp;rsquo; got me thinking about Bayes Theorem and its use as a tool in knowledge discovery.&lt;/div>

&lt;p>Stephen Hawking said he was once told that the inclusion of each equation in his book would cut the number of interested readers by 50%. Nevertheless, this one isn&amp;rsquo;t hard to grasp though it might appear to be using slightly odd syntax if you haven&amp;rsquo;t seen how conditional probabilities are expressed.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Getting married in Japan</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/japanesemarriage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Aug 2024 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/articles/japanesemarriage/</guid><description>&lt;div class="pagedescription">I’m a UK citizen, and I recently married another UK citizen in Tokyo while we were on holiday. If you&amp;rsquo;re planning to do the same, here’s a detailed guide to help you through the process. It will involve the preparation of some translations before you travel, a trip to the British Embassy in Tokyo (pre-booked), and at least one visit to a municpal office in Japan that deals with the registration of births, marriages, deaths, and divorces &amp;mdash; I recommend two visits.&lt;/div>

&lt;p>The Japanese authorities will require a document that&amp;rsquo;s equivalent to the &lt;strong>Certificate of No Impediment&lt;/strong>, known as a 婚姻要件具備証明書 (Kon-In yōken gubi shōmei sho).

&lt;p>Literary criticism has long struggled with a fundamental tension: how can we systematically analyze something as complex and multifaceted as literature while preserving its essential richness? Category theory, a branch of mathematics designed to illuminate structural relationships, offers a surprising and powerful framework for understanding how different approaches to literary analysis relate to and transform into one another. In this essay, I&amp;rsquo;ll explore how categorical thinking can deepen our understanding of literary interpretation, using specific examples to ground abstract concepts in concrete literary analysis.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
