This is what you need to do if you&rsquo;d like to attempt the same.</p><h1 id=step-1---collect-your-documents-and-translate-them>Step 1 - Collect your documents and translate them</h1><p>You&rsquo;ll need the following <strong>original</strong> documents</p><ul><li>UK passport</li><li>Document showing your current address (we used our driving licences)</li><li>Full birth certificate which shows your parents’ full names and mother’s maiden name</li></ul><p><em>plus</em></p><ul><li>an affidavit from the British Embassy (see Step 2)</li></ul><p><em>and</em></p><ul><li>a marriage registration form from a municioal office (see Step 3)</li></ul><p>Each of these will need to be translated. I used Google Translate and added the (mostly katakana) translations. At the foot of each translated copy you have to add &lsquo;Translated by <em>name of translator</em>&rsquo; (in Japanese). In my case that was: 翻訳する: デビッド ジョーンズ.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>you don&rsquo;t have to translate the entire content of your passport, just the double-page spread that has the passport number, your photo, your name, and your date of birth</em>.</p><h1 id=step-2---affidavit-from-the-british-embassy>Step 2 - Affidavit from the British Embassy</h1><p>You&rsquo;ll need to supply the Japanese authorities with the equivalent of a <strong>Certificate of No Impediment</strong> (<em>Kon-In yōken gubi shōmei sho, 婚姻要件具備証明書</em>). In our case this took the form of an affidavit supplied by the British Embassy</p><p>You get the British Embassy affidavit by applying online for an appointment <em>well in advance</em> (like, months) and paying £50 each beforehand, when you book the appointment, or on the day of the appointent at the Embassy.</p><p>Then you go to the Embassy in Tokyo, near the Imperial Palace, show them the documents they need to see (above), swear an oath in front of the Embassy official, and they&rsquo;ll give you the affidavit. It takes about half an hour and you can both attend the same appointment.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s a link to
<a href=https://www.prove-eligibility-foreign-government.service.gov.uk/japan/do-you-have-a-uk-passport rel=noopener target=_blank class=external>book an appointment at the Tokyo Embassy</a></p><h1 id=step-3----first-visit-to-the-municipal-office>Step 3 - First visit to the Municipal Office</h1><p>You&rsquo;re probably not going to get the whole thing done in a single visit. The point of the first visit for us was to get the <strong>Marriage Registration Form</strong> (<em>Kon-In Todoke, 婚姻届</em>) and to ask the helpful officials to eyeball our documents and suggest additions and alterations. So take along all your documents and translated copies and ask for help. You don&rsquo;t need a prior appoinment. Just turn up, take a ticket, and wait to be called to a desk.</p><p>We initially went to a branch office for our ward because it was nearest to our hotel but after a little confusion they told us that although the documents looked ok we&rsquo;d need to take them to the ward&rsquo;s main municipal office, so you might as well do that straight away.</p><p>Then you&rsquo;ll take away the registration form to complete it and <em>to add the details of witnesses</em>.</p><h1 id=step-4----additional-affidavit-translation>Step 4 - Additional affidavit translation</h1><p>The affidavit is <em>partly</em> translated into Japanese but that wasn&rsquo;t sufficient for the Japanese officials we spoke to - they needed some of the untranslated content to be translated ( for instance, the Japanese need to see your name in Katakana and that won&rsquo;t have been done by the Embassy), which again I did with Google translate, adding to <em>copies</em> of the affidavit (the officials made the copies for us but I don&rsquo;t think they have to do that, they were just being helpful so you might want to ask your hotel to make the copies for you).</p><p>You should be able to ask the officials you speak to in Step 3 to highlight which untranslated bits of the affidavit they need translating.</p><h1 id=step-5----fill-in-the-marriage-registration-form>Step 5 - Fill-in the Marriage Registration Form</h1><p>Compete the marriage registration form (except for the witnesses section), using the suggestions made by the municipal office staff in Step 3. You might try asking the staff to help you but you can&rsquo;t expect them to be unpaid translators.</p><h1 id=step-6----witnesses>Step 6 - Witnesses</h1><p>You need the details of two witnesses added to the registration form (they don&rsquo;t need to attend the office). We asked two young women staying at our hotel and they seemed delighted to be asked. Perhaps we were a little lucky there: it may be the trickiest part of this process if you&rsquo;re a visitor to the country and don&rsquo;t know anyone.</p><p>The details witnesses need to supply if they are Japanese are a little different from those needed if the witnesses are not Japanese. Again, it&rsquo;d be useful to ask the officials to give you some guidance when you&rsquo;re at Step 4</p><h1 id=step-7---second-and-final-visit-to-the-municipal-office>Step 7 - Second and final visit to the municipal office</h1><p>Return to the muncipal office with the complete registration form. you should now have:</p><ul><li>Two original Embassy affidavitts <strong>and</strong> copies with additional translations added.</li><li>Two UK passports <strong>and</strong> translated copies of the double-page spread that has all your details on</li><li>Two documents showing your current address(es) <strong>and</strong> translations (we used our driving licences)</li><li>Two full birth certificates <strong>and</strong> translations</li><li>One Japanese marriage registration certificate, complete with witness details (the witnesses need not be present)</li></ul><p>As mentioned earlier, each translated document should have the details of the translator at its foot.</p><h1 id=step-7----approval>Step 7 - Approval</h1><p>The official(s) you&rsquo;re dealing with should now be able to approve your marriage registration. In our case they took about an hour to check all the documents and call us to the desk again.</p><h1 id=step-8---the-kon-in-todoke-juri-shomeisho>Step 8 - the Kon-in Todoke Juri Shomeisho</h1><p>Suprisingly you don&rsquo;t get an official document recording the fact of acceptance of your marriage unless you explicitly ask for it. In our case it took about an hour for them to produce two copies that we collected from a different desk and we paid about £7 for them. The document is the &lsquo;Certificate of Acceptance of Notification of Marriage&rsquo; or, in Japanese, the <em>Kon-in Todoke Juri Shomeisho</em>. I strongly advise getting this because it&rsquo;s the only document you&rsquo;ll have to take back home with you to use in case someone ever asks for proof you&rsquo;re married.</p><h1 id=notes>Notes</h1><ul><li><p>You do not have to be permanently resident in Japan. You do not need to have a residency visa.</p></li><li><p>There is no longer any concept of registering an overseas mariage with the General Records Office back in the UK</p></li><li><p>Under UK legislation marriages involving at least one British citizen taking place abroad, before the competent local authority and which are legally valid in that country, are likely to be recognised as valid in the UK</p></li><li><p>It is remotely <em>possible</em> that for some purposes you may need further proof of marriage in the form of an <strong>apostille</strong>, a certification from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prove that the document is official and issued by its government. To get an apostille from Japanese Mistry of foreign affairs,
