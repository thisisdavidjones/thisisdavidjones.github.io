Despite [Ada Lovelace Day](https://findingada.com/), the [Ada Lovelace Institute](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/), the [Ada Lovelace Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace_Award) and Wikipedia's claim that Ada Lovelace is ['often regarded as the first computer  programmer'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace), Lovelace's contribution to programming and the history of computing is in fact minimal. Does this exaggeration matter? Is it a *noble* lie?

Not only is there no evidence that Lovelace ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.

Ada Lovelace Day is celebrated on the second Tuesday of October every year to honour Lovelace's achievements and to inspire women to pursue careers in STEM. The day is marked by events, talks, and workshops that focus on the achievements of women in STEM fields. The [Ada Lovelace Day website](https://findingada.com/) also features a database of women in STEM who can be used as role models and sources of inspiration for young girls and women who are interested in pursuing careers in these fields. Lovelace is  commemorated in statues, exhibitions, and lectures. She is regarded by some to be a pioneer and an inspiration in computing and in STEM generally.

A noble lie is a concept that originated in Plato's Republic, where it refers to a falsehood told by rulers or leaders in order to maintain social harmony or promote the greater good. The idea is that sometimes it may be necessary to tell a lie in order to create a more just and stable society, even if the lie itself is not strictly true.

For example, Plato suggests that in his ideal society, the ruling class would be told a noble lie about their origins, so that they would believe they were born with certain responsibilities and privileges that they must fulfill for the greater good of society.

The concept of a noble lie has been debated and criticized by philosophers over the years, with some arguing that it is inherently unethical to deceive people, even if it is done for a greater good. Others argue that there may be situations where a noble lie is necessary to maintain order or prevent harm. Ultimately, the idea of a noble lie raises important questions about the ethics of deception and the role of truth in society.


Myth inculcates beliefs. It is efficient in making the less philosophically inclined, as well as children (cf. Republic 377a ff.), believe noble things.  [Plato's Myths](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-myths/#PlaMyt)



although Swade is sympathetic to the situation and aspirations of Ada Lovelace, daughter of
Byron, who translated and annotated a paper describing the Analytical Engine, he is very clear that the
widespead modern conception of her as a serious collaborator on Babbage's work is incorrect

https://plus.maths.org/reviews/book3/2pdf/index.html/op.pdf

All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a “bug” in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.



{{% epigraph src="ChatGTP" %}}
whether or not Ada Lovelace can be considered the "first programmer" is a matter of debate, as there were several other pioneers in the field of computing, including Charles Babbage himself, who created designs for calculating machines that were programmable.

Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason. The engine was never completed and so her program was never tested

The Analytical Engine

The Difference Engine

Not a mathematician
Not a scientist
Not a long relationshpi with Babbge
No conribution to design


Notes to the translaiton were *co-authored* by Babbage and Lovelace
There is only one computer program in the notes and that we know to have been written by Babbage and not Lovelace

Her notes played no part in turing. Turing's work was on Hilbert's 'halting problem'

Babbage, not 'Babbage and Lovelace'

Babbage:
There is only one computer program in the notes and that we know to have been written by Babbage and not Lovelace

There were mechanical calculators long before Babbage. Pascal made one in 1642, and we now know there was even one in antiquity. But in Babbage’s day such machines were still just curiosities,


On June 5, 1833, 26 days after she was “presented at Court” (i.e. met the king), she went to a party at the house of 41-year-old Charles Babbage

by 1832 a working prototype of a small Difference Engine (without a printer) had successfully been completed. And this is what Ada Lovelace saw in June 1833.

Babbage put Lovelace in touch with De Morgan.

by late 1842 she was back to doing mathematics.

e imagined an “Analytical Engine” that supported a whole list of possible kinds of operations, that could in effect be done in an arbitrarily programmed sequence.  At first, he just thought about having the machine evaluate fixed formulas, but as he studied different use cases, he added other capabilities, like conditionals—and figured out often very clever ways to implement them mechanically.  But, most important, he figured out how to control the steps in a computation using punched cards of the kind that had been invented in 1801 by Jacquard for specifying patterns of weaving on looms.


Babbage had never published a serious account of the Difference Engine, and had never published anything at all about the Analytical Engine. But he talked about the Analytical Engine in Turin, and notes were taken by a certain Luigi Menabrea...In October 1842, Menabrea published a paper in French based on his notes. When Ada saw the paper, she decided to translate it into English and submit it to a British publication. Many years later Babbage claimed he suggested to Ada that she write her own account of the Analytical Engine, and that she had responded that the thought hadn’t occurred to her. 


She’d interacted with Michael Faraday, who apparently referred to her as “the rising star of Science”.


but she hung on, in great pain, for nearly 3 more months, finally dying on November 27, 1852, at the age of 36. Florence Nightingale, nursing pioneer and friend of Ada’s, wrote: “They said she could not possibly have lived so long, were it not for the tremendous vitality of the brain, that would not die.”



 what about the actual content of her Notes on the Analytical Engine?


 Finally comes Ada’s Note G - The Bernoulli Number Computation

 'There is no direct connection between Babbage and modenr computing (IOT)

'Ada saw herself first and foremost as an expositor. ' - Wolfram
'Ada’s achievement was to distill from these details a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never did.' - Wolfram



Lovelace - saw possibility of number representing other than quantity. Ada sayi g this is the fundamental,But babbage had already suggested algebra

Some dipute about whether she or Babbage wrote the Bernoulli numbers calc

'It was a marvellous dream'



Allan G. Bromley, in the 1990 article Difference and Analytical Engines:

All but one of the programs cited in her notes had been prepared by Babbage from three to seven years earlier. The exception was prepared by Babbage for her, although she did detect a "bug" in it. Not only is there no evidence that Ada ever prepared a program for the Analytical Engine, but her correspondence with Babbage shows that she did not have the knowledge to do so.[

Bruce Collier, who later wrote a biography of Babbage, wrote in his 1970 Harvard University PhD thesis that Lovelace "made a considerable contribution to publicizing the Analytical Engine, but there is no evidence that she advanced the design or theory of it in any way"

Eugene Eric Kim and Betty Alexandra Toole consider it "incorrect" to regard Lovelace as the first computer programmer, as Babbage wrote the initial programs for his Analytical Engine, although the majority were never publishe


Bromley notes several dozen sample programs prepared by Babbage between 1837 and 1840, all substantially predating Lovelace's notes


Dorothy K. Stein regards Lovelace's notes as "more a reflection of the mathematical uncertainty of the author, the political purposes of the inventor, and, above all, of the social and cultural context in which it was written, than a blueprint for a scientific developmen

Dorian Swade: Lovelace *published* the first thing we would now recognise as an algorithm but the work was Babbage's. The *principle* of a program was Babbage's (IOT)




Doron Swade, a specialist on history of computing known for his work on Babbage, discussed Lovelace during a lecture on Babbage's analytical engine. He explained that Ada was only a "promising beginner" instead of genius in mathematics, that she began studying basic concepts of mathematics five years after Babbage conceived the analytical engine so she could not have made important contributions to it, and that she only published the first computer program instead of actually writing it


In his book, Idea Makers, Stephen Wolfram defends Lovelace's contributions. While acknowledging that Babbage wrote several unpublished algorithms for the Analytical Engine prior to Lovelace's notes, Wolfram argues that "there's nothing as sophisticated—or as clean—as Ada's computation of the Bernoulli numbers. Babbage certainly helped and commented on Ada's work, but she was definitely the driver of it." Wolfram then suggests that Lovelace's main achievement was to distill from Babbage's correspondence "a clear exposition of the abstract operation of the machine—something which Babbage never did"
