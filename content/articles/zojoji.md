I first explored the  Zōjō-ji when i was much too early for work one day in Tokyo. I've been back several times since --- exchanging wedding rings there when in 2024 I was [married just across the road in the less remarkable  Minato City Civic Offices](/articles/japanesemarriage/).  What I've  learned about the particular flavour of Buddhism at this temple has been  very, very confusing.

**Zojo-ji Temple** is a large Buddhist temple located in the Shiba neighbourhood of Minato,  Tokyo. Nearby is Shiba Park and Tokyo's commercial districts, and **Tokyo Tower** looms over its grounds in a typical Japanese contrast of traditional and modern.

{{% sidenote %}} Tokugawa Ieyasu (1543–1616) was the founder of the Tokugawa Shogunate, which ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868. After winning the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, he centralized power, uniting Japan under a military government. Ieyasu's reign marked the start of the **Edo** period, characterized by strict social order, isolationist policies, and peace. The Tokugawa Shogunate maintained stability for over 250 years until its downfall in the **Meiji Restoration** of 1868.

The Temple was  founded in **1393** as the principal temple of the **Jōdo-shū (Pure Land sect)** of Buddhism in the Kanto region. Its prominence grew significantly in 1598 when **Tokugawa Ieyasu**, the first shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate, designated Zojo-ji as the Tokugawa family temple. Six of the Tokugawa shoguns were buried there, and it became the Tokugawa clan's spiritual centre during the Edo period. 

The original complex once spanned a vast area, but much of it was destroyed during the **Meiji Restoration** and later during **World War II** bombings. Despite this, the temple was rebuilt after the war and today the two-storey gate, the **Sangedatsumon**,  which dates back to 1622, is one of the few original structures, a relic from the Edo period. Its name refers to the idea of liberation from the three states of suffering: greed, anger, and ignorance. Walking through this gate is meant to symbolically relieve one of worldly burdens, though the modern visitor, surrounded by smartphone-carrying tourists, might find that the gate’s spiritual function is now largely symbolic.

## A crash course in Buddhism

**Jodo**, or **Pure Land**  Buddhism,  is a branch of Mahayana Buddhism.

Mahayana Buddhism began to develop out of Theravada Buddhism around the 1st century CE, several centuries after the death of Siddhartha Gautama (usually known as 'the' Buddha) as a movement that sought to reinterpret and expand upon the early teachings. While Theravada, the "Teaching of the Elders," is seen as more closely aligned with the original words of the Buddha, Mahayana, meaning the "Great Vehicle," introduced new ideas and practices. It emerged primarily in northern India and gradually spread through regions like Central Asia, China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.

The understanding of the Buddha  diverges in these two schools. Theravada presents the Buddha primarily as a historical figure, a great teacher who reached *parinirvana* after his death, no longer present in the world. Mahayana, however, holds a more expansive view, seeing the Buddha as a transcendent, eternal being. In fact, it teaches that there are countless Buddhas existing simultaneously in different realms, each working for the benefit of sentient beings.

A Bodhisattva in Mahayana Buddhism is an enlightened being who, out of compassion, postpones their own final nirvana to help others achieve enlightenment. They embody selfless compassion, dedicating themselves to liberating all sentient beings from suffering. Unlike Buddhas, who reach nirvana, Bodhisattvas remain in the cycle of rebirth to guide others on the path to enlightenment.

Another striking difference between Mahayana and Theravada is the role of the spiritual ideal. In Theravada, the focus is on becoming an *Arhat*, a person who attains personal enlightenment and liberation from the cycle of rebirth through their own efforts. Mahayana, on the other hand, emphasises the **Bodhisattva** ideal, where practitioners aspire not only for their own enlightenment but also for the salvation of all beings. A Bodhisattva  is a person who delays their final enlightenment in order to assist others on the path.

The scriptures further illustrate the distinctions. Theravada relies on the Pali Canon (Tipitaka), the earliest record of the Buddha's discourses, considered the most authentic. Mahayana developed a vast array of new scriptures, known as the Mahayana Sutras, written in Sanskrit. Texts like the **Lotus Sutra** and the **Heart Sutra** became central to their teachings,  presenting more elaborate cosmologies and philosophical developments.

Philosophically, Mahayana introduced key concepts such as *Śūnyatā*, or "emptiness," the idea that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence. It also emphasised *upaya*, or "skillful means," the notion that the Buddha adapted his teachings to suit the capacities of different audiences. Theravada, while also acknowledging the impermanence and interdependence of phenomena, tends to emphasise the **Four Noble Truths** and the **Eightfold Path** as the core framework for attaining liberation, often focusing on personal insight through meditation practices like *Vipassana*.

Rituals and practices in the two traditions also reflect these differences. Theravada centres on simplicity, with a strong emphasis on meditation, particularly insight (Vipassana) and calm (Samatha) practices. Mahayana, however, incorporates a broader array of devotional activities, including chanting, the use of mantras, and prayers to Bodhisattvas. Compassion, or karuna, is central to Mahayana practice, alongside wisdom, with great importance placed on helping others.

In terms of geographical influence, Theravada Buddhism became dominant in Southeast Asia, particularly in Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia, while Mahayana Buddhism spread more widely across East Asia, shaping religious life in countries such as China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam.

In essence, while Theravada Buddhism focuses on individual enlightenment through adherence to the Buddha’s early teachings, Mahayana opens the path to a more collective and compassionate form of practice, offering a broader, more cosmological vision of the Buddha’s role in the universe.

## Zōjō-ji and Pure Land Buddhism


 Pure Land was  rooted in Indian Mahayana Buddhism and underwent significant development as it spread to China, interacting with  Chinese philosophical and religious traditions. This interaction influenced Pure Land's doctrines, practices, and interpretations, leading to a syncretic Chinese adaptation of the tradition. It was visiting Japan again immediately after spending some weeks in Taiwan that caused me to reflect on the syncretism with Daoism represented in Pure Land Buddhism.

In **Pure Land Buddhism**, the **Western Paradise**, also known as the **Pure Land** or **Amitabha’s Pure Land**, is a celestial realm believed to be a place of bliss and liberation from the cycle of rebirth. It is presided over by the **Buddha Amitabha**, the Buddha of Infinite Light and Life. 

Practitioners of Pure Land Buddhism believe that through devotion to Amitabha and the recitation of his name (**Nembutsu** in Japanese or **Nianfo** in Chinese), one can be reborn in this Western Paradise after death. The Pure Land is not the ultimate goal of enlightenment but is considered a perfect environment for attaining it. In this land, beings are free from suffering, distractions, and negative karma, making it an ideal place for achieving the realisation of **nirvana**.

### Key aspects of the Western Paradise:
- It is depicted as a realm filled with beauty, light, and peace, with **lotus flowers**, **jewel trees**, and **lakes** of pure water.
- There is no suffering, ageing, or death, and its inhabitants can practice the Dharma under optimal conditions.
- Rebirth in the Western Paradise is seen as accessible to all, regardless of their spiritual progress, as long as they have sincere faith and devotion to Amitabha.

In Pure Land practice, Amitabha’s compassion is considered infinite, and the emphasis is on faith in his vow to save all sentient beings. This path is seen as a more accessible form of Buddhism, focusing on **faith** rather than complex meditation practices.



 Daoism places great value on the concept of *ziran* (naturalness or spontaneity), encouraging individuals to align themselves with the natural flow of life. In Pure Land Buddhism,  in contrast with the exacting  practices required in Therevada,  this concept parallels the simplicity of the Pure Land practice,   particularly the recitation of Amitabha Buddha's name (nianfo 念佛). This practice is straightforward, easy to perform, and accessible to everyone, reflecting the Daoist ideal of a simple, effortless way of spiritual cultivation.
 
 Daoism has a strong emphasis on the pursuit of immortality and transcendence, which resonated with Chinese culture. Pure Land Buddhism's promise of rebirth in the **Western Paradise** (Amitabha's **Pure Land**), a realm where practitioners can continue their path to enlightenment, mirrors the Daoist aspiration for an ideal, immortal realm. This notion of a better afterlife, a world free from suffering, was attractive to those influenced by Daoist teachings on immortality.

 During its spread in China, Pure Land Buddhism adopted certain Daoist ritual elements. Daoist rituals, including prayers and invocations to deities, were similar to Pure Land Buddhism's emphasis on invoking Amitabha Buddha for salvation. The chanting of Amitabha’s name in Pure Land practices may have been influenced by Daoist liturgical chanting and incantations, a method used to connect with divine entities.

Daoism’s concept of *wuwei* (non-action or effortless action) echoes within Pure Land thought. In Daoism, wuwei promotes living in harmony with the *Dao* without forced effort. Similarly, Pure Land emphasises the notion of "other-power" (*tariki*), where salvation is achieved not through one’s own strenuous efforts but through Amitabha Buddha’s compassion. This principle allows practitioners to rely on external help, akin to the Daoist acceptance of the flow of nature without resistance.

Pure Land Buddhism integrated Confucian ethical values, which were also shaped by Daoism, such as filial piety, reverence for ancestors, and the importance of moral conduct. These aspects were harmonised with the Buddhist path, creating a version of Buddhism that was more palatable to the Chinese, where Daoism and Confucianism already held sway. This blending of moral teachings helped to create a more holistic spiritual system that incorporated key aspects of Chinese thought

Daoism often idealised certain utopian visions, such as the land of the immortals or the Isles of the Blessed, where perfected beings reside. The Pure Land, depicted as a celestial paradise filled with beauty, peace, and ease of practice, resonated with Daoist imagery of heavenly realms. This gave the Pure Land an added appeal within a Chinese cultural context, blending Buddhist metaphysics with Daoist cosmology

Many Pure Land texts were translated or interpreted in ways that would resonate with a Chinese audience familiar with Daoist terms and concepts. For example, some translators adopted Daoist terminologies, metaphors, and symbols to make Buddhist teachings more comprehensible to the Chinese populace. This also facilitated a smoother integration of Pure Land thought with the pre-existing Daoist worldview.




 
 
 focuses on faith in **Amida Buddha** (Amitabha), who vowed to save all beings and grant them rebirth in the **Pure Land**, a paradise where achieving enlightenment is much easier. 

The practice centres on reciting **nembutsu** ("Namu Amida Butsu" – meaning "Homage to Amida Buddha") with sincere faith. This simple act is believed to guarantee rebirth in the Pure Land, bypassing the complexities of deep meditation and rigorous self-discipline seen in other Buddhist traditions. 

Pure Land Buddhism emerged in response to the belief that most people, burdened by karma and ignorance, cannot achieve enlightenment on their own. By relying on Amida's grace, even those without great spiritual prowess can attain salvation. This makes it a highly accessible form of Buddhism, particularly popular in Japan and East Asia.

## Jizo Statues: Memorials to the Lost


The temple grounds host a collection of **Jizo** statues, small stone effigies that represent the Bodhisattva Jizo, the protector of children, travelers, and the dead. These statues, frequently adorned with red bibs and knit caps, are particularly associated with mizuko, or "water children"—a euphemism for miscarried, stillborn, or aborted children. In contemporary Japan, parents dedicate Jizo statues to honor these lost souls, hoping that the Bodhisattva will guide them to a better rebirth.

The sight of these Jizo statues is visually striking: rows upon rows of small, serene figures, many with pinwheels spinning in the wind. They serve as a public testament to private grief, turning the temple into a communal space for mourning.
