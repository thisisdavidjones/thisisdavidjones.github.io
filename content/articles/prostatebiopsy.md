I've recently had a prostate biopsy at my local hospital to check whether a tumour was cancerous. I was a little anxious before the procedure so I thought I'd write about my experience  to help others understand what's involved

'It was the most painful experience of my life', said one old friend, though he added that others he knew had described theirs as merely '*uncomfortable*'.

My experience was that it was uncomfortable, occasionally a little painful, but over quickly with one or two side effects that you would find alarming if you hadn't been forewarned.

The biopsy takes a number of samples  of your prostate tissue for examination by specialists who will decide if there are signs of cancer (I suppose a biopsy can be taken to check for things beside cancer). As the prostate is immediately below your bladder, wrapped around the urethra -- the tube urine travels out through --  there are two ways of getting at the it: through the perineum (the bit underneath between your balls and your arsehole) or directly up your arse and through the walls of the rectum. The first is the *transperineal* route, the second the *intrarectal* route. As you can imagine there are increased infection risks with the intrarectal biopsy and I believe hospitals are switching over to transperineal as a preferred option but mine was still stuck with intrarectal, and that's what I'll describe here. In both cases, a rectal untrasound probe is inserted up your arse.

#antibiotics. You'll be give some antibiotics to take orally around 40 minutes or so before the biopsy. 

Secondly, you'll be shown through to some area where your details are checked for the upteenth time

The prostate, a gland about the size of a walnut when healthy, wraps around the urethra as it exits the bladder and tends to enlarge over time, often eventually causing problems (reduced urine flow, for example, or needing to get up several times in the night to visit the toilet). 

As well as this normal enlargement with age, there's the separate question of prostate *cancer*. It's said that most men ie either *of* prostate cancer or *with* prostate cancer: it's very common. So your doctor will usually run a few checks for prostate cancer too. So it's common for men of a certain age to pitch up at their doctor's office resigned to an exploratory finger

These checks will include a blood test, and a physical exam.

Sometimes the doctor will be satisfied there's nothing more to worry ab  - the prostate is initially probed via the rectum.

So how does your doctor get to the prostate to take samples? 2 methods: punch holes in your perinueum, or put a probe up your arse and drill through the wall of the rectum.



2 methods of accessing the prostate are used. 

An ultrasound-guided intrarectal prostate biopsy is a medical procedure used to diagnose prostate cancer and other prostate conditions. It involves the insertion of a specialized biopsy needle into the prostate gland through the rectum, guided by real-time ultrasound imaging.

The procedure begins with the patient lying on their side, typically in a fetal position. The physician or urologist performing the biopsy will first clean and sterilize the area around the rectum. A lubricated ultrasound probe is then gently inserted into the rectum, which allows for clear visualization of the prostate gland.

Using the ultrasound images as guidance, the physician will position the biopsy needle at specific locations within the prostate. The needle is typically mounted on a spring-loaded device that allows for controlled and precise insertion. Local anesthesia is administered to minimize discomfort during the procedure.

Once the needle is in place, the physician will quickly advance it into the prostate tissue and retrieve a small sample. Multiple samples, typically between 10 and 12, are taken from different areas of the prostate to increase the chances of detecting cancerous cells or other abnormalities. Each sample is obtained by quickly withdrawing the needle, cutting a small core of tissue, and then reinserting the needle for the next sample.

The entire procedure usually takes about 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the number of samples taken and the complexity of the case. Afterward, the needle is removed, and the patient is typically observed for a short period to ensure there are no complications.

After the biopsy, it is common to experience some mild discomfort, such as rectal bleeding or soreness in the area. These symptoms usually subside within a few days. It is also possible to have blood in the urine or semen temporarily.

The collected tissue samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis by a pathologist. The pathologist examines the samples under a microscope to determine if there are any cancerous cells or other abnormalities present. The results are typically available within a week or two.

Overall, an ultrasound-guided intrarectal prostate biopsy is a valuable diagnostic tool that allows for targeted sampling of prostate tissue to aid in the detection and characterization of prostate conditions, especially prostate cancer. It is considered a safe and effective procedure, but like any medical intervention, it carries some risks, which should be discussed with the healthcare provider prior to the biopsy.
