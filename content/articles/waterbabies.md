The first time I visited Zojo-ji temple in Tokyo I saw  scores of small statues wearing red knitted caps. They were,  I later learned dedicated to mizuko , the 'water children'.

In Japanese Buddhism  the *mizuko* (水子), or 'water children', are the souls of children who have died before birth, through miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion. In Buddhism, water often represents   impermanence and transience and thr changing nature of life and the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. A mizuko is seen as a soul that has not fully entered the world of the living, akin to water that has not yet taken a fixed form. The water imagery conveys the idea of life that was fleeting or not fully realised.

In the Japanese  tradition, the Sanzu River (三途の川, '*River of Three Crossings*') represents a spiritual divide that all  souls must cross to enter the afterlife. But the ability to cross the river is determined by the soul’s merit, reflecting how individual's lived their life. The souls of mizuko cannot transition immediately into the next life across the river because they have not buit up enough merit in their short existences. Instead, they find themselves in a , unable to cross, stranded on the bank of the river on the  *Sai no Kawara* (賽の河原), the '*Riverbed of Souls*'.


Mizuko are often imagined  - and depicted - as vulnerable, small figures   carrying or piling stones on the edge of the Sanzu.  The stones represent  their suffering and their attempts to gain merit, enabling them to cross into the afterlife.  The act of piling stones symbolises a symbolic attempt to atone for unfinished karma.

In the legend, demons (called oni) come to torment the mizuko, cruelly knocking down the stone towers to prevent the children from completing their task. This repeated destruction of the stone piles reflects  the children’s suffering and their spiritual limbo. They are unable t find peace without help.

## Protection by Jizō Bodhisattva ##
There is a figure who comforts, protects and guides the mizuko: **Jizō Bodhisattva**, one of the most beloved and revered deities in Japanese Buddhism. Known for his boundless compassion, Jizō is the protector of children, travellers, and those trapped in suffering. He is particularly known for his care of the mizuko.

Jizō is often depicted holding a staff with six rings, symbolising his ability to guide souls through the six realms of existence, and a wish-fulfilling jewel, which represents his power to grant salvation. It is said that he shelters the mizuko under his robe, offering them spiritual refuge and care. Jizō is a source of deep solace for parents, as his presence ensures that their lost children are not alone or forsaken but are lovingly cared for on the spiritual plane.

## The Role of Parents in Helping Their Mizuko  ##
Parents who have experienced the loss of a child can engage in  rituals to aid the passage of their mizuko. One of the most common practices is the offering of *mizuko kuyo*, a memorial ceremony to express  love, grief, and repentance. In these ceremonies, parents often dedicate small statues of Jizō to their lost children, symbolically entrusting their souls to the Bodhisattva's protection.

These statues, often dressed in red bibs or caps, can be seen in cemeteries or at temples, standing as silent witnesses to the sorrow of loss and the hope of spiritual reconciliation. Parents may offer flowers, incense, or even toys to their mizuko, engaging in a form of communication that transcends the physical world. These acts of devotion are believed to generate merit that can assist the water children in crossing the Sanzu River, enabling them to move forward towards their next reincarnation.

## Symbolic Interpretation ##
On a symbolic level, the plight of the mizuko and their protection by Jizō can be understood as a representation of unresolved grief and the need for healing. The idea of a child’s soul being unable to cross a river without help echoes the emotional reality of parents struggling to come to terms with the loss of a potential life. In this context, Jizō serves not only as a guardian of the children but also as a figure of emotional support for parents, guiding them through their own journey of mourning.

The stones that the mizuko carry, often depicted in Buddhist stories, may symbolise the emotional weight of grief that both the parents and the lost souls bear. The act of building a bridge with these stones represents the efforts to come to terms with loss and move toward spiritual resolution. The offering of prayers and the performance of rituals can be seen as a way to transform this grief into a meaningful action, allowing both the parents and the mizuko to find peace.

## Solace for the Living ##
For many, the belief in the mizuko and the protective role of Jizō offers a profound sense of solace. It suggests that, even in death, their children are not abandoned or left to suffer. The rituals and ceremonies provide a tangible way for parents to express their grief and love, giving them a path toward emotional healing.

On a spiritual level, these practices serve to remind us of the transient nature of life and the cyclical nature of existence in Buddhist thought. The mizuko, though lost in this life, are not lost forever. Through the compassion of Jizō and the dedication of their parents, they can move forward toward a new beginning, a new life.

In this way, the story of the mizuko can offer comfort to anyone grappling with loss. It is a reminder that while suffering is an inevitable part of the human experience, compassion, remembrance, and spiritual care can help guide us through it, bringing light to even the darkest of paths. The water children, once lost, are not forgotten—they are nurtured by love, carried through by devotion, and ultimately, they are given the chance to continue their journey.

## An echo in the UK ##

The Sands Memorial Garden at the National Memorial Arboretum in the UK is a poignant tribute dedicated to the memory of babies who have died before, during, or shortly after birth. This serene and contemplative space offers solace to grieving parents and families, providing a place for reflection and remembrance. It features delicate sculptures, including a central stone, and is surrounded by soft landscaping, symbolising the fragility of life. 

This commemoration is reminiscent of the Jizo statues. Both  serve as comforting symbols of protection and love, offering a sacred space where families can honour the memory of their lost children.
