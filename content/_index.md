This is the website of David Jones. I  occasionally  write here about travel, software and IT generally, history, art,  and books, and anything else that interests me. I'm currently rebuilding the site and I'll be bringing back a bunch of old blog posts over the next few weeks.

See the [About Page](../about.html) for information about the design principles behind this site; for information about me, social media links, and contact details see the [Links](../links.html) page.
