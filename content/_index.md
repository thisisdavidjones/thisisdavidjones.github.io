# This is an H1
This is the website of David Jones. I very occasionally  write here about anything that interests me, but mostly travel, software and IT, history, art,  and literature.

See the [About Page](/about.html) for information about the design principles behind this site; for information about me, social media links, and contact details see the [Links](/links.html) page.
