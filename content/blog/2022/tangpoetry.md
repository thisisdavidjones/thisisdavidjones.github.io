I've been trying my hand at translating Tang-era poems again. This one's by Wang Wei

And here's my translation:

{{% poetry title="Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi" attr="Wang Wei, 8th C"%}}



**Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi**

The willows at the inn are fresh and green

The dust is dampened by the morning dew

I buy my friend another cup of wine

Beyond Yang Pass, good wine and friends are few
