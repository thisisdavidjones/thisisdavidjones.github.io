I've written a few  haiku, that quintessentially Japanese verse form.

Just one point: in the West we think of the metre of haiku as being simply 5 -- 7 -- 5 syllables. In fact the most common form is 5 -- 7 -- 5 *morae*, where a **mora** is '*a unit in phonology that determines syllable weight*'. If that's not clear, try: '*something of which a long syllable consists of two and a short syllable consists of one*'.

Ok?

So it's not precisely  syllables. Japanese has some long -- not exactly stressed but *long* -- syllables. The city of Osaka is an example. It's spoken with a long initial 'O',  and written Ōsaka (o-o-sa-ka おおさか).So we'd say it has three syllables but the Japanese would count it as four morae.

So with that proviso, here are some of my efforts. Try it yourself before mocking.
