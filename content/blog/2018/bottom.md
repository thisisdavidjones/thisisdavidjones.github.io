My new ability to read _hirigana_ means I've been able to decipher, for the first time, the instructions to my hotel toilet in Tokyo last year.

The middle row in the photo has the hirigana おしり:  ***O -- Shi -- Ri***. Now I don't speak much Japanese yet so I did have to look up _oshiri_. And it means... ***bottom***.

That figures.
