I'm learning Japanese, starting with two of their three writing systems, *hirigana* and *katakana*. The third writing system that I haven't started with yet is the Chinese character inspired *kanji*, though I did learn a little traditional Chinese script a few years ago. Here's a fun thing I've only just discovered.

So the issue of the correct name for Japan isn't simple. You'll usually hear the kanji, above,  pronounced either 'Nihon' or 'Nippon'. *Nihon* and *Nippon* are valid sound readings of the two charcters, **日本**. There is government advice on which is to be used, when. Nippon is often used for official purposes these days; Nihon is the older of the two.

But that's not the interesting thing. The interesting thing is this:

The first character, **日**, is the Chinese character for '**sun**'. The second character, **本**, is the Chinese character for, among other things, '**root**', '**base**', or '**origin**'.*.

So... the two characters together mean '*the origin (root) of the sun*'. That is, *the land of the rising sun*. Neat, eh? And isn't that an interesting nuance - that Japan isn't only the land of the *rising* sun but is the very *origin* of the sun.
