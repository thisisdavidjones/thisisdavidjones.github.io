**[Chernoff faces ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chernoff_face)** represent multivariate data as different aspects of cartoon faces, relying on the brain's powerful face-processing abilities to highlight oddities. 

The principle is that we've evolved with a particularly powerful set of cognitive processes that analyse faces, because they're so important to us; so if we can represent variations in data as changes in faces, our powerful face-processing systems should spot anomalies.

This is my attempt using **[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))** for processing, on various crime-data axes for all the states in the US to see if anything leaps out.

Number 10 here is Washington DC. Something peculiar going on there....
