On holiday in Spain in 2007 I read <em>Don Quixote</em> — and ploughing through some parts in the Don’s homeland, the region of La Mancha, I thought I’d solved the puzzle of the protagonist’s name: <em>Key-Ho-Tay</em> or <em>Kwiksot</em>?

I’ve previously spoken the name ‘Don Quixote’ as Don <em>Key-ho-tay</em> although of course I’ve been aware of the alternative Don <em>Quick-Sot</em>. The version of the novel I had, the translation by John Rutherford (winner of the 2002 Primo Valle Inclàn Prize) definitely plumps for <em>Kwiksot</em> in its rhymes. For example, on page 222 (Chapter XXVI) of the paperback, he translates a poem to read:


> Enough to fill the biggest pot <br />
> Are tears of doleful Don Quixote<br />
> …<br />
> And when it touched his tender spot<br />
> Tears flowed from doleful Don Quixote<br />

So no confusion there. My previous assumption of <em>Key-ho-tay</em> was an affectation I adopted because I thought it sounded more foreign.

But hang on a moment. Checking the Spanish equivalent I find it reads:

> ‘Y en tocándole el cogote,<br />
> Aquí lloró Don Quijote’<br />
— El Ingenioso Hidalgo de Don Quijote de la Mancha. Capítulo XXVI

<em>Quijote</em>, it turns out, is the modern Spanish rendition, after spelling reforms — <em>Quixote</em>K is the spelling in medieval Castilian — and according to <em>Yahoo’s Spanish Dictionary: translation of cogote</em>, ‘cogote’ is pronounced <em>Koggo-tay</em>, which would mean that Quixote is said <em>Key-Ho-Tay</em> after all.

Obviously, Rutherford’s translation is cleverly making allowance for a traditional English mispronunciation. On another page his translation reads,

> ‘…Don Biscuit, or Don Fixit, or Don Riskit’.
> ‘Don Quixote he must have said, Lady,’ Sancho interrupted

Which carries through the Kwiksot pronunciation. And as Wikipedia points out, traditional English rendering is also preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival form <em>quixotic</em>.
