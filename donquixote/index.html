The version of the novel I had, the translation by John Rutherford (winner of the 2002 Primo Valle Inclàn Prize) definitely plumps for <em>Kwiksot</em> in its rhymes. For example, on page 222 (Chapter XXVI) of the paperback, he translates a poem to read:</p><blockquote><p>Enough to fill the biggest pot<br>Are tears of doleful Don Quixote<br>…<br>And when it touched his tender spot<br>Tears flowed from doleful Don Quixote<br></p></blockquote><p>So there seems to be no confusion there. Rutherford is rhyming with &lsquo;pot&rsquo; and &lsquo;spot&rsquo;. My previous assumption that the pronunciation was <em>Key-ho-tay</em> was a mistake, an affectation I&rsquo;d adopted because I thought it sounded more foreign.</p><p>But hang on a moment. Checking the Spanish equivalent I find it reads:</p><blockquote><p>‘Y en tocándole el <strong>cogote</strong>,<br>Aquí lloró Don <strong>Quijote</strong>’<br>— <em>El Ingenioso Hidalgo de Don Quijote de la Mancha. Capítulo XXVI</em></p></blockquote><p><em>Qui<strong>j</strong>ote</em>, it turns out, is the modern Spanish rendition, after spelling reforms — <em>Qui<strong>x</strong>ote</em> is the spelling in medieval Castilian — and according to <em>Yahoo’s Spanish Dictionary: translation of cogote</em>, ‘cogote’ is pronounced <em>Koggo-tay</em>.</p><p>Which would mean that Quixote is said <em>Key-Ho-Tay</em> after all.</p><p>It appears that Rutherford’s translation is cleverly making allowance for a traditional English mispronunciation. For instance, on another page his translation reads,</p><blockquote><p>‘…Don Biscuit, or Don Fixit, or Don Riskit’.
‘Don Quixote he must have said, Lady,’ Sancho interrupted</p></blockquote><p>Which carries through the <em>Quick-Sot</em> pronunciation. And as Wikipedia points out, traditional English rendering is also preserved in the pronunciation of the adjectival form <em>quixotic</em>.</p></section></article></main></body></html>
