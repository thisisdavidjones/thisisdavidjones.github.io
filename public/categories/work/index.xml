No estimate can be 100% certain. So how can we calculate and express that certainty?

We&amp;rsquo;re going to run simulations, that&amp;rsquo;s how.
Monte Carlo Simulation The Monte Carlo method uses a large number of random or pseudo-random numbers generated between some interval with some distribution.</description></item><item><title>Estimation the simple, old-fashioned way</title><link>http://askdavidjones.com/estimation/simpleold/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Mar 2018 21:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://askdavidjones.com/estimation/simpleold/</guid><description>So to begin with let&amp;rsquo;s look at a very common way of producing estimates &amp;ndash; with a little twist &amp;ndash; and then think about how it can be improved.

First, break the project up into features and then into small tasks. Your tasks should be a matter of hours long, not days or, god forbid, weeks. If your tasks are too long you it suggests you haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about what&amp;rsquo;s really involved in programming them.</description></item></channel></rss>
