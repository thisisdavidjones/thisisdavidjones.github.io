We were due to stay there from Wed 3rd Aug - Sunday 7th Aug 2022.
We arrived at Saxonis Houses in the afternoon of Wednesday 3rd. There was no-one to welcome us or check us in but we had a phone number so we called it and the owner, Vasilis, answered and said he&amp;rsquo;d be along soon.</description></item></channel></rss>
