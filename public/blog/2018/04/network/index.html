I have a NAS with tens of thousands of ripped music files and I&rsquo;d like to play them, easily, on my Sonos speakers and/or my Echo Dots.</p><figure class=figimg><a href=https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/785/41384732332_d8c12601f5_z.jpg><img src=https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/785/41384732332_d8c12601f5_z.jpg alt="The salient bits of my home network"></a><span class=marginnote><p>The salient bits of my home network</p></span></figure><p>Now I could upload them to some subscription service, and use the streaming capabilities - but it seems to me a bad idea for three reasons:</p><ul><li>it seems overkill for my requirements</li><li>it&rsquo;s an additional expense</li><li>it&rsquo;s not as much fun as rolling my own solution</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m much more enthusiastic about voice control than I thought I&rsquo;d be. I have a couple of Echo Dots and a Google Home Mini and the convenience makes me think there&rsquo;s a real future to this.</p><p>Just an aside - I have already managed to issue commands to the Echo to play my own music files on my Sonos speakers. I installed Plex on a Raspberry Pi 3, did a scan of my NAS-based music libraries, and installed the Sonos app on the Echo Dot. Hey presto, it just worked.</p><p>But it&rsquo;s a bit clunky, and besides, I wanted to write my own AWS lambda for control. I&rsquo;ve written a couple of Alexa Skills just to investigate what&rsquo;s involved and I have a fair amount of experience with lambdas so I&rsquo;m pretty confident I can get that bit working. The part I&rsquo;m a little hazy on at the moment is the callback from the lambda to Plex on my home network. I&rsquo;ll need to investigate the Plex API, and see what&rsquo;s involved in securely opening a port for inbound lambda calls.</p><p>Ideally, I&rsquo;d like to be able to issue commands such as :</p><ul><li><em>Alexa</em> <em><strong>mymusic</strong></em> <em>play {track name}</em></li><li><em>Alexa</em> <em><strong>mymusic</strong></em> <em>play {artist}</em></li><li><em>Alexa</em> <em><strong>mymusic</strong></em> <em>play {playlist}</em></li></ul><p>And so on. If it works I&rsquo;ll opensource it.</p></section></article></body></html>
