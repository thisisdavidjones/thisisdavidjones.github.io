It&rsquo;s not in my usual style but I was aiming for a sort of Japanese vernacular - think Herg√© out of Hasui Kawase.</p><p>This summer, Helen and I are trying to sort out the most efficient travelling sketch kits. It&rsquo;s inevitable, if you draw at all, that you accumulate hundreds of pens and pencils, always looking for that elusive ideal tool that will make all your drawings wonderful. And I expect we&rsquo;ll be a bit loaded down with kit during our days out so we need to travel as light as possible. I&rsquo;m thinking two or three pens, an 8-colour watercolour kit and some water pens.</p></section></article></body></html>
