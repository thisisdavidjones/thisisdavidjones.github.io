So for Pi Day I&rsquo;ve been looking at Monte Carlo simulations in R. Here&rsquo;s the result of a simple simulation of pi.</p><figure class=figimg><a href=https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4783/26935809968_780bd8b61b_z.jpg><img src=https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4783/26935809968_780bd8b61b_z.jpg alt="Four simulation runs to estimate pi with an increasing number of iterations"></a><span class=marginnote><p>Four simulation runs to estimate pi with an increasing number of iterations</p></span></figure><p>Four runs, the first with 1,000 iterations; the second with 10,000; the third with 100,000, the fourth with 1,000,000. Finally got a value for pi of 3.141144 (it&rsquo;s really 3.14159&mldr;.etc).</p><p>It works by generating a number of vectors (1,000, 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000) representing points between 0 and 1; and then working out the proportion that lie within a quadrant of unit radius</p><p>The R code is very simple - <a href=https://github.com/thisisdavidjones/piday>piday on github here</a>:</p><pre tabindex=0><code>set.seed()

piest = length(which(z&lt;=1))*4/length(z)

The decimal expansion of π doesn&rsquo;t just go on forever. π is an <em>irrational</em> number and a <em>transcendental</em> number.</p><p><strong>Irrational</strong> means that the number can&rsquo;t be expressed as a <em>ratio</em> of two numbers - like 22/7, for example. Irrational numbers annoyed the Ancient Greeks terribly but we&rsquo;re comfortable with them.</p><p>A <strong>transcendental</strong> number is one that is not a root of a non-zero polynomial (with integer or rational coefficients). That might be a bit more of a stumbling block for some people so to explain:</p><p>You can think of a <em>polynomial</em> as an algebraic equation, like:</p><p>x<sup>2</sup> − 4x + 7 = 0</p><p>It has a more technical definition that you can look up but it&rsquo;ll do for now. You might remember <em>solving</em> equations like these and (in the case of these sort of equations) getting two &lsquo;solutions&rsquo;. Those were the <em>roots</em> of the equation.</p><p>So a <em>transcendental</em> number is one that&rsquo;s never a root of any equation like that. Not all irrational numbers are transcendental. For example, the square root of 2 is famously irrational, and famously upset the Greeks, but it isn&rsquo;t transcendental because it is a root of x<sup>2</sup> − 2 = 0.</p><p>The set of transcendental numbers is uncountably infinite. That&rsquo;s a <em>bigger</em> infinity than the set of all natural numbers, the ordinary counting numbers. And, yes, some infinities are bigger than other.</p></section></article></body></html>
