David Deutsch has a very interesting chapter on this in, <em>&lsquo;The Beginning of Infinity&rsquo;</em>, and he concludes that the argument there cannot be objective aesthetic standards is a relic of empiricism; that there are in fact aesthetic truths.</p><p>Deutsch is a physicist. For a philosopher, take Scruton, the UK&rsquo;s formost authority on the philosophy of beauty. Scruton says the following things are true:</p><ul><li>beauty pleases us</li><li>one thing can be more beautiful than another</li><li>beauty is always a reason for attending to the thing that possesses it</li><li>beauty is the subject matter of a judgment of taste.</li><li>the judgment of taste is about the beautiful object, not about the subject&rsquo;s state of mind</li><li>there are no second-hand judgments of beauty - a person cannot argue another into such a judgment.</li><li>the judgment of taste is a genuine judgment, one that is supported by reasons</li></ul><p>Scruton is conservative - small <strong>c</strong> and big <strong>C</strong> - and you might think his judgement smacks of his politics. But in this, at least, I think he&rsquo;s right.</p><p>He also says:</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Much that is said about beauty and its importance in our lives ignores the minimal beauty of an unpretentious street, a nice pair of shoes or a tasteful piece of wrapping paper&mldr;." Moreover, &ldquo;these minimal beauties are far more important to our daily lives&mldr;than the great works&mldr;&rdquo;</p></blockquote></blockquote><p>And talking of the minimally beautiful&mldr;Vermeer was an artist who found great beauty in the ordinary. We might consider his scenes of 17th Century Dutch life to be merely <em>charming</em>, partly because of historical distance. But then look at the Vermeer scullery maid juxtaposed with a woman flipping burgers in a van. The Vermeer allows us to see the burger woman in another way. We <em>wouldn&rsquo;t</em> have noticed the beauty in the mundane if we hadn&rsquo;t been familiar with the Vermeer.</p></section></article></body></html>
