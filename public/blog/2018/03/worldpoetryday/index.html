Here are two nominations, both inspired by Ancient Greece, the first contemporary and the second around 2,000 years old.</p><h3 id=alice-oswald-memorial>Alice Oswald, <em>Memorial</em></h3><p>My most recent discovery and keeper has been Alice Oswald - especially <em>&lsquo;Memorial&rsquo;</em>, a retelling of the Iliad with only the deaths left in. She was trained as a classicist and sometimes calls this a translation, but it isn&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s an original work inspired by Homer.</p><figure class=figimg><a href=https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/803/41015495511_d9d12e4871_z.jpg><img src=https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/803/41015495511_d9d12e4871_z.jpg alt="Achilles kills the Amazon queen Penthesilea"></a><span class=marginnote><p>Achilles kills the Amazon queen Penthesilea</p></span></figure><blockquote><p>Like the hawk of the hills the perfect killer<br>Easily outflies the clattering dove<br>She dips away but he follows he ripples<br>He hangs his black hooks over her<br>And snares her with a thin cry<br>In praise of her softness</p></blockquote><p>Marvellous, that: &lsquo;<em>And snares her with a thin cry / In praise of her softness&rsquo;</em>. Or there&rsquo;s this gory description of just one of the many killings:</p><blockquote><p>And PEDAEUS the unwanted one<br>The mistake of his father&rsquo;s mistress<br>Felt the hot shock in his neck of Meges&rsquo; spear<br>Unswallowable sore throat of metal in his mouth<br>Right through his teeth<br>He died biting down on the spearhead</p></blockquote><p>The whole, long poem is a relentless piling of death on death. Oswald has performed the entire thing live from memory on occasion. She&rsquo;s my nomination for Poet Laureate in a few years.</p><h3 id=ovid-heroides-i---penelope-to-ulysses>Ovid, <em>Heroides I - Penelope to Ulysses</em></h3><p>This was written around the second or third decade BC, in the era of Augustus. I happened across this when I heard of a book called, <em>&lsquo;Where Troy Once Stood&rsquo;</em>, which argued, bizarrely, that the historic events on which the legend of Troy are based occurred in and around East Anglia. The river <em>Scamander</em> was the Cam, and so on. I thought the title was such an arresting phrase it had to be a reference to something, but I didn&rsquo;t know what. So I found out.</p><p>Ovid, innovator that he was, wrote a set of epistolary poems in the voices of heroic, legendary or mythical women. Quite a remarkable thing for his time. The line came from the first letter, Penelope writing desparingly to her long-absent husband, Ulysses (Odysseus). She says that for her, Troy isn&rsquo;t over, it&rsquo;s still standing, effectively, or might as well be, given that Ulysses is still missing. Here it is in context:</p><blockquote><p>there are fields now, where Troy once stood, and the earth,<br>beneath the scythe, crops densely, rich with Phrygian blood:<br>half-buried bones of heroes are struck by the curving plough,</p></blockquote><p>Ovid spent his last days exiled in a small town on the shores of the Black Sea, far away from the cultured Rome that was his natural environment, though there is a suggestion from one bright scholar that this &rsquo;exile&rsquo; was itself a poetic conceit, invented by Ovid to allow him to adopt a voice in poems extolling the beauty and delights of Rome as seen from a far by a yearning exile. It&rsquo;s a minority opinion.</p></section></article></body></html>
