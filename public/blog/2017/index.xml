The principle is that we&amp;rsquo;ve evolved with a particularly powerful set of cognitive processes that analyse faces, because they&amp;rsquo;re so important to us; so if we can represent variations in data as changes in faces, our powerful face-processing systems should spot anomalies.
This is my attempt using R for processing, on various crime-data axes for all the states in the US to see if anything leaps out.</description></item></channel></rss>
