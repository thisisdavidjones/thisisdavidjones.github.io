In 2009 I commemorated the 200th anniversary of Charles Darwin&amp;rsquo;s birth by creating a Twitter feed that published excerpts every day from the diary he kept on board the Beagle, as he sailed around the world. The idea was that on June 21st - say - here, it&amp;rsquo;d be June 21st back in 1832, and the Twitter stream would display whatever Charles had written on that day.
Although Darwin&amp;rsquo;s diary is out of copyright and available online, as is the book he published about the voyage, as are the letters he wrote back home, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a conveniently prepared repository of tweets.</description></item></channel></rss>
