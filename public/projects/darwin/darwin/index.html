The idea was that on June 21st - say - here, it&rsquo;d be June 21st back in 1832, and the Twitter stream would display whatever Charles had written on that day.</p><p>Although Darwin&rsquo;s diary is out of copyright and available online, as is the book he published about the voyage, as are the letters he wrote back home, there wasn&rsquo;t a conveniently prepared repository of tweets. That&rsquo;s where the work came in.</p><p>I created a database to hold the content, and then created a Twitter App to push the Tweets to the @cdarwin twitter account. Over the next five years I kept ahead of the voyage by sitting down on a Saturday morning and sorting through the diary and the letters to extract that single sub-140 letter phrase that might amuse, entertain or educate.</p><p>It seemed to go down well - I had around 22,000 followers on Twitter - and after finishing the voyage I decided to go round again with it. After a while, though, the fun palled. So I decided to publish the voyage in real time to Facebook instead. This time, the setup was a little more sophisticated.</p><p>I wrote a REST API sitting in front of the database. Then I created an AWS Lambda using Python that queries the REST API and sends an update confirming that content was received. Then it pushes that content into Facebook, using FB&rsquo;s API.</p><p>So now Charles is off again. As I write it&rsquo;s the 14th February 1832 and he hasn&rsquo;t quite reached the coast of Brazil yet. His voyage around the world lies ahead of him.</p></section></article></body></html>
