No estimate can be 100% certain. So how can we calculate and express that certainty?</p><figure class=figimg><a href=https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3877/14396523136_6c5e0f785c_z.jpg><img src=https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3877/14396523136_6c5e0f785c_z.jpg alt="Airport baggage carousel, Venice.

It was invented by Stanislaw Ulam, quickly taken up by the polymathic genius, John von Neumann, and was kept under wraps for a few years because they were both working on the Manhatten Project at the time. The idea is fairly simple - instead of struggling with advanced combinatorial calculations you use a computer to generate a large number of simulations and <em>observe</em> the result.</p><h5 id=monte-carlo-in-estimation>Monte Carlo in estimation</h5><p>In the case of task estimation the spread could be decided upon by using the single-point estimate as the mean of a normal distribution, and choosing a likely standard deviation (this does raise the question as to whether actual task times vary from estimates according to a normal distribtion but we&rsquo;ll keep things simple for now).</p><p>Or, we could enhance the estimation process by asking the estimator to supply a <em>worst case</em>, a <em>best case</em> and a <em>most likely case</em>.</p><p>Either way, we&rsquo;re going run a large number of simulations and use the resulting spread of numbers to give us a cumulative probability distriubtion.</p><p>The simulations can be run in Excel, which I&rsquo;ve used in the past. I&rsquo;m going to try using <strong>R</strong> just because I&rsquo;m teaching myself a little more about <strong>R</strong> and <strong>RStudio</strong>.</p><h5 id=who-wants-to-know>Who wants to know</h5><p>Why are we doing this again?</p><p>It&rsquo;s because, when developers supply single-point &rsquo;estimates&rsquo;, the developers themselves are tacitly deciding upon the appropriate level of risk to be accepted in a project. But that is <strong>not</strong> appropriate - no business should be content with unquantified project risk being obscured in this way.</p><p>The amount of risk to be accepted on a project is a <strong>business</strong> decision, not a <strong>developer</strong> decision and pretending otherwise is bad project management, bad business decision-making, and bad estimation practice. I think it happens for two reasons: managers often don&rsquo;t <em>understand</em> this point; and very poor managers actively <em>want</em> the decision to be made by someone else because they&rsquo;re so accustomed to projects missing targets by substantial amounts that their working practice is to start by identifying people to blame.</p><p>Next: an worked example of a Monte Carlo simulation on project task estimates</p></section></article></body></html>
