Four simulation runs to estimate pi with an increasing number of iterations
Four runs, the first with 1,000 iterations; the second with 10,000; the third with 100,000, the fourth with 1,000,000.</description></item><item><title>Pi Day: estimating pi with Monte Carlo simulations</title><link>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2018/03/piday/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Mar 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2018/03/piday/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s Pi Day (because of the weird American date convention of m.d.y the date is 3.14 in the US).

The principle is that we&amp;rsquo;ve evolved with a particularly powerful set of cognitive processes that analyse faces, because they&amp;rsquo;re so important to us; so if we can represent variations in data as changes in faces, our powerful face-processing systems should spot anomalies.
This is my attempt using R for processing, on various crime-data axes for all the states in the US to see if anything leaps out.</description></item><item><title>Respository activity visualised</title><link>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2015/11/repovisualised/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Nov 2015 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2015/11/repovisualised/</guid><description>My development team being busy.
