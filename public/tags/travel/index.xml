We were due to stay there from Wed 3rd Aug - Sunday 7th Aug 2022.
We arrived at Saxonis Houses in the afternoon of Wednesday 3rd. There was no-one to welcome us or check us in but we had a phone number so we called it and the owner, Vasilis, answered and said he&amp;rsquo;d be along soon.</description></item><item><title>Isabella Bird</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/04/isabellabird/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Apr 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/04/isabellabird/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m reading a book about Japan by the remarkable Isabella Bird.
Isabella Bird
I don&amp;rsquo;t remember ever caring much about travel writing when I was younger but, coinciding with my own travelling further afield, I&amp;rsquo;ve read more of it. Theroux, naturally, and Thubron; but also older efforts, like Thesiger, Robert Byron, Eric Newby. And going way back I really enjoy travel writing from a time when it was unusual-to-near-impossible to make the journeys made, where travelling was exploring.</description></item><item><title>Sketching in Japan</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/03/sketchinginjapan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/03/sketchinginjapan/</guid><description>Two schoolchildren, Tokyo
Although I was working most of the time when I visited Japan last year I did manage to pop in to a couple of excellent museums and I spent some snatched moments taking a few photographs and doing a spot of sketching.
Hence this quick drawing I did in the street, walking down towards Tokyo Tower and the Zojoji Temple. It&amp;rsquo;s not in my usual style but I was aiming for a sort of Japanese vernacular - think Hergé out of Hasui Kawase.</description></item><item><title>Japanese for 'bottom'</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/03/bottom/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/03/bottom/</guid><description>Toilet controls on my Japanese toilet
My new ability to read hirigana means I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to decipher, for the first time, the instructions to my hotel toilet in Tokyo last year.
The middle row in the photo has the hirigana おしり: O &amp;ndash; Shi &amp;ndash; Ri. Now I don&amp;rsquo;t speak much Japanese yet so I did have to look up oshiri. And it means&amp;hellip; bottom.
That figures.</description></item><item><title>I think I'm learning Japanese</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/01/learningjapanese/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Jan 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/blog/2018/01/learningjapanese/</guid><description>A moment ago my phone sent me an alert to tell me that it was time to revise my Japanese. The app, LingoDeer, thinks I could do with practising my Katakana - and it&amp;rsquo;s not allowing me to move on with my vocabulary until it&amp;rsquo;s satisfied with my progress. The slightly dispiritng progress tracker tells me I&amp;rsquo;m 1.1% through the training.
Last year I went to Japan to kick off a software project that will be rolled-out around the world.</description></item></channel></rss>
