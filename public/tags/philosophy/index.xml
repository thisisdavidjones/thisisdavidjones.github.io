In Part 3 - Personal Identity, for example, he considers a Star Trek-like matter transporter. Imagine, he writes, a scanner here on Earth that &amp;lsquo;reads&amp;rsquo; the complete state of all the cells of your body, and in the process destroys them and transmits the information to a receiving station on Mars, where a Replicator will construct an exact copy of you, with all your memories.</description></item></channel></rss>
