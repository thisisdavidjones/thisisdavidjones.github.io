Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi
The willows at the inn are fresh and green
The dust is dampened by the morning dew
I buy my friend another cup of wine
Beyond Yang Pass, good wine and friends are few â€” Wang Wei, 8th C</description></item><item><title>Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi</title><link>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2022/08/seeingoffyuan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2022/08/seeingoffyuan/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying my hand at translating Tang-era poems again.

For example, take a look at this painting of a bird by Li Anzhong, early-mid 1100s.
Bird on a Branch by Li Anzhong
And this is typical, and unremarkable, and just one example of thousands of beautiful paintings from the period. As for the poetry, I read a fair amount of it before I went to China a few years back.</description></item></channel></rss>
