The Greeks at Delphi used the ravings of a priestess possibly high on methane and ethanol to make famously ambiguous predictions. Ancient Rome used sacred chickens and the innards of slaughtered animals. Other historical methods of divination include:
pyromancy (by fire) ophiomancy (by snakes) pegomancy (by spring water) anemoscopy (by wind) daphnomancy (by burning laurel wreaths) hippomancy (by horses) tiromancy (by cheese) Way out East, Ancient China used the patterns made by throwing yarrow stalks to the ground as a starting point for cleromancy using the I Ching.</description></item></channel></rss>
