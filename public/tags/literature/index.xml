I hadn&amp;rsquo;t really and the criticism smarted so I went off to learn about semiology. And then postmodernism. I quite liked some Roland Barthes. I read Jonathan Culler on deconstruction &amp;ndash; &amp;ldquo;On Deconstruction&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; and I read Derrida, and Baudrillard, and de Man, and Foucault, and Lacan, and more.</description></item><item><title>Ancient Greek literature: it's really rather good</title><link>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2018/03/ancientgreeklit/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Mar 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>http://askdavidjones.com/blog/2018/03/ancientgreeklit/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a longtime fan of the Iliad &amp;ndash; I think one of my old primary school teachers must have read a version to my class when I was an infant because I seem to have known the stories forever.

On holiday in Spain in 2007 I read Don Quixote — and ploughing through some parts in the Don’s homeland, the region of La Mancha, I thought I’d solved the puzzle of the protagonist’s name: Key-Ho-Tay or Kwiksot?
I’ve previously spoken the name ‘Don Quixote’ as Don Key-ho-tay although of course I’ve been aware of the alternative Don Quick-Sot.
