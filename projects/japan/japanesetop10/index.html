The closest English translation would be “excuse me”, but sumimasen is a phrase that can be used for many things including “sorry”, “thanks” and as an introduction before asking a question. If you bump into someone it’s polite to say a quick sumimasen, but it can also be used if you’re trying to get someone’s attention or before taking something you were offered.</p></li><li><p>WAKARIMASEN (PRONOUNCED: “WAH-KAH-REE-MAH-SEN”)
It’s important to indicate that you do not understand something. If someone starts talking to you in Japanese and you don’t understand, reply wakarimasen. After saying a polite wakarimasen, you can try slowly speaking English, and the speaker will be much more understanding of the language barrier and will hopefully try to help you or find you an English speaker.</p></li><li><p>KUDASAI (PRONOUNCED: “KOO-DAH-SIGH”)
A more casual word for “please”, you’ll use this word often when making requests, asking for favors and even for ordering food. See an item on a menu you’d like to have? Just point and say kore (ko-reh) kudasai (“this please”) or simply state the object in front– fanta kudasai! (“fanta please!”)</p></li></ol></section></article></body></html>
