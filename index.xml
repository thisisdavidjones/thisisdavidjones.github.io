I&amp;rsquo;ve closely followed the suggestions of Edward Tufte&amp;rsquo;s stylesheet recommendations for simple and clear text on the web, and a long-standing aim is that markup should be as close to purely semantic as possible. The principles derived by Dave Liepmann from Tufte&amp;rsquo;s writings are guidelines, not mandatory diktats, but they&amp;rsquo;re very useful guidelines.</description></item><item><title>Seeing off Yuan the Second on a Mission to Anxi</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/poetry/seeingoffyuan/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Aug 2022 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/poetry/seeingoffyuan/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying my hand at translating Tang-era poems again.

At the northern end stands their recently-completed spindly bamboo mast; halfway along one of the longer sides is a rickety hut on thin stilts. Running down the center of the cleared area, a strip of flattened sandy scrub, like a giants&amp;rsquo; cricket pitch. Twenty metres beyond the southern end of the clearing, through the jungle greenery, is a strand of white sand, and then the sea.</description></item><item><title>The Banach-Tarski Paradox</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/stem/banachtarski/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Mar 2018 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/stem/banachtarski/</guid><description>Given a solid ball in 3‑dimensional space, there exists a decomposition of the ball into a finite number of disjoint subsets, which can then be put back together in a different way to yield two identical copies of the original ball.The reassembly process involves only moving the pieces around and rotating them without changing their shape.
The Banach-Tarski Paradox
This &amp;lsquo;paradox&amp;rsquo; is a firm result in set theory. It&amp;rsquo;s not up for debate.</description></item><item><title>Pronouncing Don Quixote in La Mancha</title><link>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/donquixote/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Nov 2016 06:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://thisisdavidjones.github.io/donquixote/</guid><description>Pizarro in the market square of Trujillo, Spain
On holiday in Spain in 2007 I read Don Quixote — and ploughing through some parts in the Don’s homeland, the region of La Mancha, I thought I’d solved the puzzle of the protagonist’s name: Key-Ho-Tay or Kwiksot?
I’ve previously spoken the name ‘Don Quixote’ as Don Key-ho-tay, presuming it was more Spanish, though of course I’ve been aware of the alternative inEnglish of Don Quick-Sot.</description></item></channel></rss>
